## Laravel RestFul Api

This is a very simple representation of how restful apis work with laravel. The code is easy to understand, I return items from my 
database in json.
clone this repository and use postman or curl ('since you're such a bad ass') to access what I have done.

I plan to extend this application, you know make it more complex, will add Test Soon. So watch out
